COLLEGE RUNNER

Description:- This is a game totally based on an impromptu idea. The idea is that a student 
			runs around on-Campus trying to cover maximum distance by dodging questions from 
			his professors.If a Professor catches you your run has ended unless you are able 
			to answer his/her question. In such a case you get another shot at the run with 
			the existing score. If you fail to answer the question its Game Over. Although on 
			the way you get powerups in the form of Beer glasses to help you dodge better.

Development Platform:- Unity 5.6.6

			1. Web Platform
			2. Android Application
			3. iOS Application
			4. xBOX

Future Scope:- Currently the application graphics are moderate and can be improved based on the
			no. of assets. Assets like:
